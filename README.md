Readme:

This is a quick proof of concept project that demonstrates double precision spaceflight in unity.

The project is unsupported, and expect some things to be broken.

The project implements basic double precision math function, and basic double precision hierarchy support.

The ship cannot be controlled (then again, this wouldn't be hard to fix), and is launched at a flyby course near the moon.

Planets and the ship move according to newtonian mechanics, using their real speeds and masses. Meaning sun, moon and earth interact with each other.

Controls:

Arrow keys: Rotate camera.
Shift + Arrow keys: Roll camera.
+/- : increase/decrease time dilation (you really don't wanna fly from the moon in realtime)

The project uses public domain images from NASA.

This is all.
